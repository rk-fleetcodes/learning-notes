# Testing Mastery

This volume was added for Staff+ frontend engineering depth. It focuses on runtime behavior, production failure modes, architecture decisions, and interview-grade reasoning.

## Testing Pyramid

### What Is It?
Testing Pyramid is a concrete engineering discipline inside Testing Mastery; treat it as a production system with ownership, failure modes, observability, and user impact.

### Why Does It Exist?
It exists because large frontend applications need predictable delivery across teams, devices, networks, security boundaries, and deployment environments.

### Internal Working
At runtime, the important question is: where does work execute, when is data available, what cache owns it, what can fail, and what user-visible state appears while the system recovers.

### Runtime Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant U as User
participant UI as Frontend UI
participant R as Runtime/Framework
participant API as API or Platform
participant O as Observability
U->>UI: interaction/navigation
UI->>R: schedule/render/load work
R->>API: fetch, stream, import, or mutate
API-->>R: response/error/partial data
R-->>UI: commit visible state
UI->>O: metric, trace, error, breadcrumb
```

### Real Production Example
A production SaaS dashboard uses Testing Pyramid when a user changes tenant, navigates to a lazily loaded route, fetches permission-scoped data, handles a partial outage, and still emits enough telemetry for on-call engineers to diagnose the issue.

### Source Code Analysis
```ts
type ProductionBoundary = {
  owner: string;
  input: 'navigation' | 'user-event' | 'server-data' | 'build-artifact';
  failure: 'timeout' | 'version-mismatch' | 'unauthorized' | 'render-error';
  metric: 'INP' | 'LCP' | 'error-rate' | 'cache-hit-rate';
};
```

### Common Bugs
- Hidden coupling between teams or packages.
- Missing fallback UI for slow or failed work.
- Cache invalidation that ignores tenant, locale, role, or feature flag.
- No trace connecting frontend symptom to backend or build artifact.

### Debugging Strategies
Use a reproduction URL, user/session metadata, release SHA, network waterfall, React Profiler commit, browser performance trace, and logs/traces tied by correlation ID.

### Performance Considerations
Measure JavaScript cost, network waterfalls, cache hit rate, hydration or route transition time, memory growth, and long tasks. Do not optimize abstractions before measuring user-visible latency.

### Security and Accessibility Considerations
Security: isolate trust boundaries, validate server decisions, avoid leaking tenant or user data, and fail closed. Accessibility: preserve focus, announce async state changes, keep keyboard paths working, and avoid UI that only communicates through color or motion.

### Interview Questions
#### Beginner
1. What problem does Testing Pyramid solve?
2. What is the user-visible failure state?
3. What browser or React tool would you use first?

#### Intermediate
1. How would you design ownership boundaries for Testing Pyramid?
2. How would caching, retries, and rollback work?
3. Which metric proves the design works?

#### Advanced
1. How would Testing Pyramid behave during partial outage, deploy rollback, or version skew?
2. How would you make it observable across micro-frontends or server-rendered routes?
3. What trade-off would you document in an ADR?
