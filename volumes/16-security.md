# XSS

## Introduction

XSS is a foundational Security topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for XSS.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

The browser parses bytes into DOM/CSSOM, schedules JavaScript tasks, calculates style/layout, paints pixels, composites layers, and enforces security boundaries such as origin and CSP.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

## Mental Models

- Restaurant analogy: XSS is like the workflow between order taking, kitchen preparation, serving, and cleanup.
- Airport analogy: requests and events move through queues, priorities, gates, and security checks.
- Library analogy: references point to books on shelves; losing the catalog reference makes a book eligible for cleanup.
- Warehouse analogy: caching and indexing trade storage cost for faster retrieval.

E --> F[Layout]
F --> G[Paint]
G --> H[Composite]
```

## Step-by-Step Examples

```js
element.textContent = userInput; // safer than innerHTML
```

Line-by-line explanation:

1. Identify declarations and allocate necessary bindings.
2. Create runtime values or references.
3. Execute the synchronous part first.
4. Schedule asynchronous, rendering, or cleanup work if present.
5. Observe the final state through logs, UI, network panel, profiler, or tests.

Specific explanation: Treat user data as text unless it has been sanitized by a trusted sanitizer.

## Memory Visualizations

```text
Stack / Execution Records
main() frame
  local binding -> ref:0x001

Heap
0x001 -> { topic: "XSS", lifecycle: "created -> used -> cleaned" }

GC rule
reachable from stack/module/global/subscription => kept
unreachable after cleanup => collectible
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- React hooks and component state synchronization.
- React Query or cache invalidation workflows.
- Debouncing input and avoiding unnecessary network calls.
- Authentication, authorization, and guarded routes.
- Notifications, chat, optimistic updates, uploads, and realtime dashboards.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating XSS as syntax instead of a lifecycle and ownership problem.
- Forgetting cleanup for listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, or pending requests.
- Confusing microtasks, tasks, render work, and React commits.
- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

## Best Practices

- Make ownership explicit.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.
- Prefer native browser semantics before custom JavaScript.
- Add tests for normal, boundary, and failure behavior.
- Document invariants and trade-offs.

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: identify whether work is O(1), O(n), O(n log n), or worse.
- Space complexity: track retained objects, caches, closures, and subscriptions.
- Rendering cost: avoid unnecessary DOM work, style recalculation, layout, paint, and React re-renders.
- Re-renders: stabilize keys, props, callbacks, and derived data only when measurement shows benefit.
- Memory impact: release references and cap cache size.

## Edge Cases

- Null, undefined, empty arrays, duplicate IDs, and unexpected types.
- Slow network, offline mode, retries, cancellation, and race conditions.
- Browser tab suspension and page visibility changes.
- Server/client mismatches during hydration.
- Accessibility states such as focus, disabled, expanded, selected, and live updates.

# CSP

## Introduction

CSP is a foundational Security topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for CSP.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

The browser parses bytes into DOM/CSSOM, schedules JavaScript tasks, calculates style/layout, paints pixels, composites layers, and enforces security boundaries such as origin and CSP.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

## Best Practices

- Make ownership explicit.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.

- Document invariants and trade-offs.

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: identify whether work is O(1), O(n), O(n log n), or worse.
- Space complexity: track retained objects, caches, closures, and subscriptions.
- Rendering cost: avoid unnecessary DOM work, style recalculation, layout, paint, and React re-renders.
- Re-renders: stabilize keys, props, callbacks, and derived data only when measurement shows benefit.
- Memory impact: release references and cap cache size.

## Edge Cases

- Null, undefined, empty arrays, duplicate IDs, and unexpected types.
- Slow network, offline mode, retries, cancellation, and race conditions.
- Browser tab suspension and page visibility changes.
- Server/client mismatches during hydration.
- Accessibility states such as focus, disabled, expanded, selected, and live updates.

# Authentication

## Introduction

Authentication is a foundational Security topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for Authentication.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

JavaScript engines parse source, create execution contexts, allocate primitives on stack-like records and objects on the heap, execute through an interpreter/JIT, and reclaim unreachable memory with garbage collection.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

## Mental Models

- Restaurant analogy: Authentication is like the workflow between order taking, kitchen preparation, serving, and cleanup.
- Airport analogy: requests and events move through queues, priorities, gates, and security checks.
- Library analogy: references point to books on shelves; losing the catalog reference makes a book eligible for cleanup.
- Warehouse analogy: caching and indexing trade storage cost for faster retrieval.

## Visual Diagrams

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Source Code] --> B[Parse]
B --> C[Execution Context]
C --> D[Call Stack]
C --> E[Heap]
D --> F[Result/Side Effect]
```

## Step-by-Step Examples

```js
const topic = "Authentication";
console.log(`Learning ${topic} deeply`);
```

Line-by-line explanation:

1. Identify declarations and allocate necessary bindings.
2. Create runtime values or references.
3. Execute the synchronous part first.
4. Schedule asynchronous, rendering, or cleanup work if present.
5. Observe the final state through logs, UI, network panel, profiler, or tests.

Specific explanation: This minimal snippet creates, stores, and reads a value related to Authentication; expand it with real inputs, errors, and measurement.

## Memory Visualizations

```text
Stack / Execution Records
main() frame
  local binding -> ref:0x001

Heap
0x001 -> { topic: "Authentication", lifecycle: "created -> used -> cleaned" }

GC rule
reachable from stack/module/global/subscription => kept
unreachable after cleanup => collectible
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- React hooks and component state synchronization.
- React Query or cache invalidation workflows.
- Debouncing input and avoiding unnecessary network calls.
- Authentication, authorization, and guarded routes.
- Notifications, chat, optimistic updates, uploads, and realtime dashboards.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Authentication as syntax instead of a lifecycle and ownership problem.
- Forgetting cleanup for listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, or pending requests.
- Confusing microtasks, tasks, render work, and React commits.
- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

## Best Practices

- Make ownership explicit.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.
- Prefer native browser semantics before custom JavaScript.
- Add tests for normal, boundary, and failure behavior.
- Document invariants and trade-offs.

- Time complexity: identify whether work is O(1), O(n), O(n log n), or worse.
- Space complexity: track retained objects, caches, closures, and subscriptions.
- Rendering cost: avoid unnecessary DOM work, style recalculation, layout, paint, and React re-renders.
- Re-renders: stabilize keys, props, callbacks, and derived data only when measurement shows benefit.
- Memory impact: release references and cap cache size.
