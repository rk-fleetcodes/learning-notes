# Basics

## Introduction

Basics is a foundational TypeScript Mastery topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for Basics.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

TypeScript checks source with structural typing, performs inference, erases types during emit, and leaves runtime behavior to JavaScript.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

## Mental Models

- Restaurant analogy: Basics is like the workflow between order taking, kitchen preparation, serving, and cleanup.
- Airport analogy: requests and events move through queues, priorities, gates, and security checks.
- Library analogy: references point to books on shelves; losing the catalog reference makes a book eligible for cleanup.
- Warehouse analogy: caching and indexing trade storage cost for faster retrieval.

```

## Step-by-Step Examples

```js
const topic = "Basics";
console.log(`Learning ${topic} deeply`);
```

Line-by-line explanation:

1. Identify declarations and allocate necessary bindings.
2. Create runtime values or references.
3. Execute the synchronous part first.
4. Schedule asynchronous, rendering, or cleanup work if present.
5. Observe the final state through logs, UI, network panel, profiler, or tests.

Specific explanation: This minimal snippet creates, stores, and reads a value related to Basics; expand it with real inputs, errors, and measurement.

## Memory Visualizations

```text
Stack / Execution Records
main() frame
  local binding -> ref:0x001

Heap
0x001 -> { topic: "Basics", lifecycle: "created -> used -> cleaned" }

GC rule
reachable from stack/module/global/subscription => kept
unreachable after cleanup => collectible
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- React hooks and component state synchronization.
- React Query or cache invalidation workflows.
- Debouncing input and avoiding unnecessary network calls.
- Authentication, authorization, and guarded routes.
- Notifications, chat, optimistic updates, uploads, and realtime dashboards.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Basics as syntax instead of a lifecycle and ownership problem.
- Forgetting cleanup for listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, or pending requests.
- Confusing microtasks, tasks, render work, and React commits.
- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

## Best Practices

- Make ownership explicit.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.
- Prefer native browser semantics before custom JavaScript.
- Add tests for normal, boundary, and failure behavior.
- Document invariants and trade-offs.

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: identify whether work is O(1), O(n), O(n log n), or worse.
- Space complexity: track retained objects, caches, closures, and subscriptions.
- Rendering cost: avoid unnecessary DOM work, style recalculation, layout, paint, and React re-renders.
- Re-renders: stabilize keys, props, callbacks, and derived data only when measurement shows benefit.
- Memory impact: release references and cap cache size.

## Edge Cases

- Null, undefined, empty arrays, duplicate IDs, and unexpected types.
- Slow network, offline mode, retries, cancellation, and race conditions.
- Browser tab suspension and page visibility changes.
- Server/client mismatches during hydration.
- Accessibility states such as focus, disabled, expanded, selected, and live updates.

# Conditional Types

## Introduction

Conditional Types is a foundational TypeScript Mastery topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for Conditional Types.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

TypeScript checks source with structural typing, performs inference, erases types during emit, and leaves runtime behavior to JavaScript.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

## Mental Models

- Restaurant analogy: Conditional Types is like the workflow between order taking, kitchen preparation, serving, and cleanup.
- Airport analogy: requests and events move through queues, priorities, gates, and security checks.
- Library analogy: references point to books on shelves; losing the catalog reference makes a book eligible for cleanup.
- Warehouse analogy: caching and indexing trade storage cost for faster retrieval.

## Real-World Use Cases

- React hooks and component state synchronization.
- React Query or cache invalidation workflows.
- Debouncing input and avoiding unnecessary network calls.
- Authentication, authorization, and guarded routes.
- Notifications, chat, optimistic updates, uploads, and realtime dashboards.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Conditional Types as syntax instead of a lifecycle and ownership problem.
- Forgetting cleanup for listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, or pending requests.
- Confusing microtasks, tasks, render work, and React commits.
- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

- Re-renders: stabilize keys, props, callbacks, and derived data only when measurement shows benefit.
- Memory impact: release references and cap cache size.

## Edge Cases

- Null, undefined, empty arrays, duplicate IDs, and unexpected types.
- Slow network, offline mode, retries, cancellation, and race conditions.
- Browser tab suspension and page visibility changes.
- Server/client mismatches during hydration.
- Accessibility states such as focus, disabled, expanded, selected, and live updates.

# Infer

## Introduction

Infer is a foundational TypeScript Mastery topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for Infer.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

TypeScript checks source with structural typing, performs inference, erases types during emit, and leaves runtime behavior to JavaScript.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

## Mental Models

- Restaurant analogy: Infer is like the workflow between order taking, kitchen preparation, serving, and cleanup.
- Airport analogy: requests and events move through queues, priorities, gates, and security checks.
- Library analogy: references point to books on shelves; losing the catalog reference makes a book eligible for cleanup.
- Warehouse analogy: caching and indexing trade storage cost for faster retrieval.

## Visual Diagrams

C --> D[Emit JS]
D --> E[Runtime JS]
```

## Step-by-Step Examples

```js
const topic = "Infer";
console.log(`Learning ${topic} deeply`);
```

Line-by-line explanation:

1. Identify declarations and allocate necessary bindings.
2. Create runtime values or references.
3. Execute the synchronous part first.
4. Schedule asynchronous, rendering, or cleanup work if present.
5. Observe the final state through logs, UI, network panel, profiler, or tests.

Specific explanation: This minimal snippet creates, stores, and reads a value related to Infer; expand it with real inputs, errors, and measurement.

## Memory Visualizations

```text
Stack / Execution Records
main() frame
  local binding -> ref:0x001

Heap
0x001 -> { topic: "Infer", lifecycle: "created -> used -> cleaned" }

GC rule
reachable from stack/module/global/subscription => kept
unreachable after cleanup => collectible
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- React hooks and component state synchronization.
- React Query or cache invalidation workflows.
- Debouncing input and avoiding unnecessary network calls.
- Authentication, authorization, and guarded routes.
- Notifications, chat, optimistic updates, uploads, and realtime dashboards.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Infer as syntax instead of a lifecycle and ownership problem.
- Forgetting cleanup for listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, or pending requests.
- Confusing microtasks, tasks, render work, and React commits.
- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

## Best Practices

- Make ownership explicit.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.
- Prefer native browser semantics before custom JavaScript.
- Add tests for normal, boundary, and failure behavior.
- Document invariants and trade-offs.

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: identify whether work is O(1), O(n), O(n log n), or worse.
- Space complexity: track retained objects, caches, closures, and subscriptions.
- Rendering cost: avoid unnecessary DOM work, style recalculation, layout, paint, and React re-renders.

- Browser tab suspension and page visibility changes.
- Server/client mismatches during hydration.
- Accessibility states such as focus, disabled, expanded, selected, and live updates.

# Advanced Type Inference

## Introduction

Advanced Type Inference is a foundational TypeScript Mastery topic. Mastery means you can use it correctly, predict its behavior, debug production issues, explain internals, and connect it to interviews, architecture, accessibility, security, and performance.

## Why This Concept Exists

* What problem does it solve? It reduces ambiguity around how frontend systems represent data, run code, render UI, communicate over networks, and recover from failure.
* Why was it introduced? It emerged because applications needed more predictable, reusable, observable, and scalable ways to manage complexity.

## Core Fundamentals

- Definition: know the exact vocabulary for Advanced Type Inference.
- Contract: identify inputs, outputs, side effects, ownership, lifecycle, and cleanup.
- Boundaries: separate language behavior, browser behavior, framework behavior, and application policy.
- Correctness: cover happy path, loading path, empty state, error state, retry path, and cleanup path.
- Production readiness: include tests, monitoring, documentation, performance budgets, and accessibility/security review where relevant.

## Internal Working

Explain step-by-step what happens internally.

TypeScript checks source with structural typing, performs inference, erases types during emit, and leaves runtime behavior to JavaScript.

For JavaScript topics:

* Memory: primitives are stored directly in execution records where possible; objects, arrays, functions, and closures live on the heap and are referenced.
* Execution Context: creation phase builds bindings and scope links; execution phase evaluates statements and expressions.
* Call Stack: synchronous frames push and pop; long frames block input and rendering.
* Engine Behavior: engines optimize stable shapes and predictable types, but can deoptimize polymorphic or megamorphic hot paths.

For React topics:

* Rendering: React calls components to describe UI.
* Reconciliation: React compares previous and next element trees using type and key.
* Fiber: work is represented as interruptible units linked in a tree.
* Scheduler: urgent updates can be prioritized over non-urgent rendering.

For Browser topics:

* DOM: parsed HTML becomes nodes and relationships.
* CSSOM: CSS becomes matched style rules.
* Rendering Pipeline: style, layout, paint, and composite turn data into pixels.

## Mental Models

- Restaurant analogy: Advanced Type Inference is like the workflow between order taking, kitchen preparation, serving, and cleanup.
- Airport analogy: requests and events move through queues, priorities, gates, and security checks.
- Library analogy: references point to books on shelves; losing the catalog reference makes a book eligible for cleanup.
- Warehouse analogy: caching and indexing trade storage cost for faster retrieval.

```

## Step-by-Step Examples

```js
const topic = "Advanced Type Inference";
console.log(`Learning ${topic} deeply`);
```

Line-by-line explanation:

1. Identify declarations and allocate necessary bindings.
2. Create runtime values or references.
3. Execute the synchronous part first.
4. Schedule asynchronous, rendering, or cleanup work if present.
5. Observe the final state through logs, UI, network panel, profiler, or tests.

Specific explanation: This minimal snippet creates, stores, and reads a value related to Advanced Type Inference; expand it with real inputs, errors, and measurement.

## Memory Visualizations

```text
Stack / Execution Records
main() frame
  local binding -> ref:0x001

Heap
0x001 -> { topic: "Advanced Type Inference", lifecycle: "created -> used -> cleaned" }

GC rule
reachable from stack/module/global/subscription => kept
unreachable after cleanup => collectible
```

## Real-World Use Cases

- React hooks and component state synchronization.
- React Query or cache invalidation workflows.
- Debouncing input and avoiding unnecessary network calls.
- Authentication, authorization, and guarded routes.
- Notifications, chat, optimistic updates, uploads, and realtime dashboards.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating Advanced Type Inference as syntax instead of a lifecycle and ownership problem.
- Forgetting cleanup for listeners, timers, subscriptions, observers, or pending requests.
- Confusing microtasks, tasks, render work, and React commits.
- Ignoring empty, duplicate, stale, failed, or slow states.
- Adding abstractions before the problem repeats.

## Best Practices

- Make ownership explicit.
- Keep side effects at boundaries.
- Prefer native browser semantics before custom JavaScript.
- Add tests for normal, boundary, and failure behavior.
- Document invariants and trade-offs.

## Performance Considerations

- Time complexity: identify whether work is O(1), O(n), O(n log n), or worse.
- Space complexity: track retained objects, caches, closures, and subscriptions.
- Rendering cost: avoid unnecessary DOM work, style recalculation, layout, paint, and React re-renders.
- Re-renders: stabilize keys, props, callbacks, and derived data only when measurement shows benefit.
- Memory impact: release references and cap cache size.

## Edge Cases

- Null, undefined, empty arrays, duplicate IDs, and unexpected types.
- Slow network, offline mode, retries, cancellation, and race conditions.
- Browser tab suspension and page visibility changes.
- Server/client mismatches during hydration.
- Accessibility states such as focus, disabled, expanded, selected, and live updates.
